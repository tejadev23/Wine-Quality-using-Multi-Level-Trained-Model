🍷 Wine Quality Prediction using CNN  

🔬 **AI-driven Wine Quality Assessment** | **97.19% Accuracy**  

This project implements a **Multi-Level Trained CNN Model** to predict wine quality based on **physicochemical properties** like acidity, pH, residual sugar, and alcohol content. The model is trained on a dataset from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository** and outperforms traditional machine learning models such as **Random Forest and SVM**.  

## 🚀 Features  
✔️ Preprocessed and normalized wine datasets for high accuracy  
✔️ Implemented and compared **CNN, Random Forest, and SVM** models  
✔️ Achieved **97.19% accuracy**, surpassing traditional ML techniques  
✔️ Published at **Kongunadu College of Engineering and Technology**  
✔️ Future enhancements: **Hybrid CNN architectures & Transfer Learning**  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset is sourced from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository** and contains **physicochemical attributes** of red wine samples.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** (TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)  
- **Machine Learning** (CNN, Random Forest, SVM)  
- **Data Processing** (Feature Engineering, Normalization)
